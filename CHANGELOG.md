# Changelog

## Unreleased

## v0.1.0-beta.2 (`@better-convex/mcp`)

- Add the experimental provider-neutral Convex-native MCP package on the locked
  `2026-07-28` release candidate and exact official TypeScript SDK beta.
- Certify one immutable package through direct public-client PKCE with Better
  Auth and an independent signed-token verifier, both deployed through real
  Convex HTTP Actions without bearer-token passthrough.
- Prove locked-RC stateless discovery, tools, live authorization and revocation,
  safe application failures, transport bounds, and explicit unsupported
  capabilities while retaining truthful legacy conformance evidence.
- Rebuild authenticated requests as credential-free SDK inputs, narrow the
  transport to bounded unary tools/resources, and require live Better Auth
  authority validation.
- Use the RC-required stateless `server/discover` envelope in every exact
  external consumer; the unpublished beta.1 artifact was retired after its
  independent Convex consumer exposed legacy initialize negotiation.

## v0.8.0-beta.11

- Add the optional `better-convex-vue/mcp-app` lifecycle entry on the exact
  official MCP Apps SDK without pulling MCP dependencies into ordinary Vue.
- Prove progressive fallback, host-mediated tool and link behavior, restrictive
  iframe boundaries, exact teardown, and credential-free production bundles
  through neutral and Ginko CMS consumers.
- Repair identity-generation dispatch fencing, authentication coordination,
  query/pagination state, official-client SSR, Better Auth relationship
  semantics, read-only JWKS discovery, and raw-cause containment.
- Certify the packed Nuxt lifecycle with a complete `convex/browser` fixture
  surface after the beta.9 candidate correctly failed its production bundle
  gate.
- Coordinate Vue and Nuxt with the same clean source commit as the corrected
  MCP beta.2 candidate; the passing beta.10 pair remains immutable but is not
  reused across source commits.

## v0.8.0-beta.4

- Bind auth-schema release certification to the exact immutable Nuxt and Vue
  candidate tarballs, so unpublished companion versions never fall through to
  the public registry during packed deployment proof.

## v0.8.0-beta.3

- Settle auth-enabled anonymous Vue clients through the exact
  `convex@1.42.2` public browser-client surface, without relying on an
  unavailable `clearAuth()` method.
- Prove anonymous settlement and cross-tab realtime updates against one exact
  trusted Better Auth/Nuxt origin before rebuilding the Vue/Nuxt candidate pair.

## v0.8.0-beta.2

- Add the provider-neutral `better-convex-vue` embedded-runtime attachment used
  by separately bundled Vue applications without exposing tokens or a
  replaceable raw Convex client.
- Complete the Nuxt-to-Vue lifecycle hard cut for client ownership, identity
  fencing, queries, pagination, mutations, and actions while preserving Nuxt
  SSR and authentication behavior.
- Accept Convex's nullable terminal pagination cursor and certify the shared
  lifecycle through the Ginko Studio proving consumer.
- Render deterministic connection telemetry during Nuxt SSR before the
  client-only shared Vue runtime is installed.

## v0.8.0-beta.0

- Establish the Better Convex vNext architecture and executable implementation
  ledger without adding premature public packages or compatibility paths.
- Prove the two official-SDK MCP deployment topologies against neutral fixtures,
  including exact-call binding, canonical Convex values, OAuth bearer isolation,
  URL-interaction safety, and credential-free Vue MCP App boundaries.
- Add package-qualified, descriptor-bound release certification for artifact
  identity, production manifests, entry purity, dependency direction, SBOMs,
  maintained consumers, and runtime fingerprints while preserving the existing
  Nuxt package behavior.
- Refresh vulnerable build and protocol-laboratory transitive dependencies to
  their patched releases after the release advisory gate identified newly
  published archive, URL-parser, SVG, shell-parser, and Hono advisories.

## v0.7.0-beta.1

- Certify the installed `better-convex-nuxt/server` entry through a production
  Nitro query, mutation, and action lifecycle, including structured,
  unstructured, transport, authentication, and diagnostic-redaction evidence.
- Document safe application-owned server-call diagnostics and the runtime-only
  `ConvexCallError.cause` boundary without exposing a debug hook, raw cause,
  additional error kind, or testing API.

## v0.7.0-beta.0

- Preserve a valid local-backend startup timeout through the checked Convex CLI
  runner without treating it as deployment authority, and reject invalid
  non-positive values before starting Convex.
- Document the independent social-login, OAuth authorization-server, and
  resource-server roles, plus the deployment-wide Convex token-exchange quota
  and the application-owned authorization boundary.
- Certify the packed package through a byte-compared npm consumer, a production
  Nitro authentication lifecycle, and strengthened OAuth/MCP browser evidence.
- Resolve Convex session-token verification through the deployment-owned HTTP
  Actions JWKS route, so remote deployments can authenticate local Nuxt apps
  without requiring a public tunnel to the host origin.
- Treat credential-free browser token bootstrap as `200 { token: null }` while
  preserving `401` for malformed, expired, revoked, or unsupported credentials.
  The client and OpenAPI contracts now expose `string | null`, eliminating the
  expected anonymous request failure without weakening session validation.
- Bound every shipped cookie-to-token exchange to its H3 request and one
  ingress-authenticated client IP. Production auth now requires an explicit
  single-IP ingress header and a private Nuxt-to-Convex signing secret; the raw
  public token-exchange helper was removed so consumers cannot collapse users
  onto one Nitro egress rate-limit identity.
- Abort and quarantine active and queued uploads when the authenticated identity
  generation changes, preventing work started by one principal from publishing
  state or callbacks under the next principal.
- Enforced canonical compound uniqueness for accounts, organization members,
  and team members inside the adapter mutation, including update and concurrent
  create paths. This advances the generated schema fingerprint to v2 as a
  greenfield hard cut; do not deploy over populated v1 auth data without first
  auditing and reconciling duplicates.
- Corrected the local setup contract to use the Convex-managed `.env.local` as
  the single local deployment configuration, with Nuxt commands loading it
  explicitly instead of documenting a competing `.env` file. A checked Convex
  CLI runner now parses that authority once, rejects ambiguous selectors and
  target overrides, removes inherited Convex settings, and permits deploy only
  with a production deployment-scoped key or exact self-hosted authority.
- Expanded diagnostic redaction for common consumer-defined JWT, API-key,
  private-key, bearer, and passphrase labels.

### Authentication platform hard cut

- Replaced the legacy component dependency with one package-owned Better Auth
  component, one generated schema contract, and one adapter implementation used
  by both the packaged and advanced local-component modes.
- Added persisted-session-only Convex JWT exchange, additive JWKS rotation,
  strict same-origin proxying, database-backed rate limiting, versioned secrets,
  protected credential storage, and real-backend concurrency invariants.
- Regenerated and freshness-gated the Team and Agentic SaaS local-component
  schemas from their canonical Better Auth options; local-component consumers
  must regenerate schema and metadata together when plugin tables change. Their
  final component schemas now use those generated tables directly, so untracked
  hand-added indexes cannot diverge from the adapter descriptor. The generator
  now owns the organization membership, team membership, pending-invitation, and
  `createdAt` sort indexes used by live authorization and pagination.
- Added the constrained OAuth authorization-server beta and delegated MCP path
  with authorization code plus PKCE, exact issuer/client/resource/subject/scope
  binding, live Convex authorization, consent and revocation, and no refresh or
  dynamic-registration compatibility path.
- Added one internal, time-bounded `URL.canParse` capability fill because the
  pinned Convex isolate lacks the primitive required by the pinned official
  OAuth Provider. Real-backend evidence pins the removal trigger; this is not a
  second auth or protocol path.

### Release and verification

- Added immutable candidate artifacts, candidate-rooted SBOM and provenance
  evidence, clean-consumer verification, security sentinels, fuzzing, mutation
  testing, OAuth/MCP interoperability harnesses, and protected cloud rehearsal.
- Added safe, opt-in structured auth diagnostics and an exact-tarball
  pkg.pr.new preview workflow for black-box consumer testing before npm
  publication.
- Added an explicit destructive `external-disposable` MCP evidence mode for a
  fresh already-running preview deployment; the self-contained local fixture
  remains the default and no external lifecycle or cleanup path is inferred.
- Made exact-tarball MCP fixtures derive their isolated runtime links from the
  product and starter manifests, so workspace ancestor resolution cannot hide a
  missing production dependency.
- Removed migration documentation and every maintained legacy runtime path. This
  is a greenfield-only beta and does not migrate an existing auth database.

## v0.6.1

[compare changes](https://github.com/lupinum-dev/better-convex-nuxt/compare/v0.6.0...v0.6.1)

### 🔒 Dependency and CI hardening

- Updated the exact supported Convex version to `1.42.1` across the package,
  fixtures, demo, and maintained starters.
- Updated the release toolchain, including ESLint 10, Playwright 1.61,
  `@nuxt/eslint-config` 1.16, `@vitejs/plugin-vue` 6.0.8, `convex-test` 0.0.54,
  lint-staged 17, oxfmt 0.59, and the latest compatible stable supporting
  packages.
- Updated pinned GitHub Actions for checkout, Node setup, pnpm setup, and
  TruffleHog; the TruffleHog binary input now matches the pinned action, and
  checkout credentials are not persisted into subsequent job steps.
- Kept TypeScript on the latest compatible 5.9 release because TypeScript 7 is
  outside the current Nuxt, ESLint, and Convex peer ranges.

### ✅ Reliability

- Adapted error construction and local assignments to the stricter ESLint 10
  rules without changing public behavior.
- Made the small Convex backend test corpus run serially, avoiding CPU-contention
  timeouts while preserving the existing per-test failure bound.
- Regenerated and frozen-validated the exact candidate resolution in the demo
  and all five maintained starters.

## v0.6.0

[compare changes](https://github.com/lupinum-dev/better-convex-nuxt/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.0)

This is the vNext hard cutover. It replaces the pre-0.6 auth, query-argument,
error, and server-call surfaces outright — there is no compatibility shim and
no deprecation period. Upgrading requires reading the sections below; most
consumers will need source changes.

### 🔒 Security hardening

- Fixed authentication to one same-origin `/api/auth` proxy, GET/POST only,
  with one validated upstream request, no server-side redirect following, and
  no caller-controlled forwarding headers.
- Preserved request bytes and one deadline through complete response
  consumption, including bounded request/response bodies and deterministic
  stream cancellation.
- Made Better Auth's public reactive session the canonical client identity
  source across built-in, raw, and plugin operations, MFA settlement, expiry,
  cross-tab logout, and account switching.
- Serialized complete sign-in, sign-up, and sign-out operations so stale work
  cannot publish a superseded identity.
- Removed cross-origin CORS/trusted-origin configuration, custom proxy routes,
  the cross-request JWT cache, and its public clear helper.
- Hardened maintained demo and starter Convex functions with server-side
  authorization, tenant ownership checks, bounded reads/writes, pagination,
  body limits, and invariant tests.
- Narrowed supported Nuxt versions to `^4.4.0`; Better Auth, its Convex adapter,
  and Convex use exact tested peer versions.

### ✅ Release assurance

- Added deterministic isolated E2E execution, real Nitro proxy probes, seeded
  proxy property tests, browser identity lifecycle coverage, and a two-tab
  session/account-switch matrix.
- Added a machine-checked OWASP ASVS 5.0.0 Level 2 responsibility/evidence
  ledger covering all 253 applicable Level 1/2 controls.
- Added production dependency auditing, CycloneDX SBOM generation, secret
  scanning, CodeQL, pinned CI actions, Dependabot, and exact-tarball release
  gates across the demo and all five maintained starters.
- Release preparation now builds and packs once, verifies that exact immutable
  tarball, records its manifest and SHA-256, and leaves npm publication and Git
  tagging as explicit operator actions.

### 💥 Breaking changes

**Auth installation, config, and runtime topology**

- Removed `auth.enabled` as a separate boolean. Authentication now installs by
  default (or via an options object); pass `auth: false` as the sole
  off-switch. `defaults.auth` no longer exists.
- Removed `auth.cache.enabled` and `auth.unauthorized.enabled`/`auth.unauthorized`.
  The auth cache option is now a plain `false | options` value with no nested
  `enabled` flag, and unauthorized-route recovery no longer exists in module
  options, runtime config, or source.
- Removed `auth: 'auto'`. Query auth modes are exactly `required | optional | none`,
  with identical meaning on client and server. The default mode is `optional`.

**Query modes and cross-identity isolation**

- `optional`/`required` queries now wait for initial auth settlement before
  running, and are partitioned by the caller's stable identity key plus an
  `identityGeneration` counter — no query, paginated page, optimistic update,
  mutation/action result, upload, callback, or seeded-profile state can leak
  across a sign-in/sign-out/user-switch boundary.
- `none` queries always use a dedicated, permanently anonymous transport and
  never observe a Convex identity, even when the app is otherwise signed in.
- Same-user token rotation (refresh) no longer forces query reacquisition.
- Every identity-key change (anonymous↔user, user↔user) retires and closes the
  previous primary `ConvexClient` and replaces it; the public `useConvex()`
  handle and the dedicated anonymous client stay stable across the swap.

**Explicit query arguments; surface removal**

- Queries must always be called with an explicit args object or the literal
  string `'skip'`. Omitted-argument calls (e.g. `useConvexQuery(api.x.y)`) are
  no longer accepted.
- Removed `getQueryKey` and the `better-convex-nuxt/composables` subpath.
  Public types are imported from the package root.

**`ConvexCallError`**

- Introduced `ConvexCallError` as the one public error type for both throwing
  and safe (`{ data, error }`-style) call paths. It survives Nitro/SSR
  serialization with its identity and public fields (`kind`, `code`, `message`,
  `status`, `data`) intact; `cause` is never serialized or logged.
- Unstructured upstream response bodies can no longer reach public errors,
  logs, or payloads.

**Typed Better Auth client**

- Better Auth client plugins are now registered once per Nuxt app through
  `defineConvexAuthClient` in a project's `convex-auth.ts`, using the
  framework-free `better-convex-nuxt/auth-client` entry. Removed
  `createBetterConvexAuthClient`, `resolveBetterConvexAuthBaseURL`, and the
  `BetterConvexAuthClientOptions`/`BetterConvexAuthClientPluginList` types.

**Atomic sign-in/sign-up**

- `signIn`/`signUp` now synchronize the Convex identity automatically as part
  of the call; there is no manual post-sign-in/sign-up refresh step. `refresh()`
  remains available only for advanced raw-client or claim-change flows.
- `useConvexAuth()` is available both when auth is enabled and when it is
  disabled (module option `auth: false`), reporting status `'disabled'` in the
  latter case.

**Server caller and credential exchange**

- `serverConvex` is now the only public server call API. Removed
  `serverConvexQuery`, `serverConvexMutation`, `serverConvexAction`, and
  `useConvexCall`.
- Better Auth cookie credential exchange is bounded, never follows a redirect
  with the credential attached, and never logs secrets. Raw Better Auth session
  tokens are not accepted as public bearer credentials.
- Removed the built-in `permissions` module option (both the `true` and
  `false` states) and the `createPermissions` permissions runtime. Permission
  rules are application/Convex policy, not library machinery. Replace package
  permission helpers with an application-owned UI capability composable backed
  by Convex queries, and continue enforcing authorization inside Convex handlers.

### 🧹 Cleanup

- Deleted `research/` and `experiments/` (concluded Phase 0 exploration,
  distilled into `src/ARCHITECTURE.md` and ADRs where durable; retained only in
  Git history).
- Removed the Phase 0 `test/proofs/auth-races`, `test/proofs/isolation`,
  `test/proofs/onupdate-rebinding`, and `test/proofs/ssr-errors` prototype
  fixtures; their guarantees are now covered by permanent unit, Nuxt, and e2e
  tests (`test/unit/auth-generation-races.test.ts`, `test/unit/client-owner.test.ts`,
  `test/nuxt/auth-two-app-isolation.nuxt.test.ts`,
  `test/e2e/ssr-errors-consumer.e2e.test.ts`, and related identity/anonymous-
  transport Nuxt tests).

### 📖 Documentation

- Rewrote guides and examples onto the final vNext API (explicit query args,
  `optional`-by-default auth modes, `serverConvex`, `defineConvexAuthClient`,
  the replacement-safe `useConvex()` handle, structured error classification,
  and application-owned UI capabilities).
