You've completed the guide. You can now build real-time Nuxt apps with authentication, permissions, and type-safe data. But there's more to explore.

The rest of the docs are organized into three sections:

## Patterns

Short, copy-paste solutions for common problems. Each pattern shows you how to build something specific.

## What to Read Next

**Building a feature?** Start with Patterns. Find the closest example and adapt it.

**Debugging something weird?** Read Concepts. Understanding the architecture helps you predict behavior.

**Looking up an option?** Go to Reference. Find the composable, scan the table.

Most people jump between all three. That's the point — they're designed to complement each other.
