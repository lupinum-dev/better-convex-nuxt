 * have declared keys (`keyof` is not `never`) and are left untouched, so they
 * stay callable with `{ limit: 5 }`.
 *
 * The `T extends unknown` wrapper forces distribution over union args (from a
 * top-level `v.union(...)` validator) so each member is judged by its own
 * keys — without it, `keyof (A | B)` is the key *intersection*, which is
 * `never` for disjoint members and would wrongly collapse the whole union to
 * the empty-args type.
 *
 * Exported for the `serverConvex` caller, which applies the same no-argument
 * tightening as the client contract: a no-arg server call must still pass `{}`,
 * and an options-shaped object can never occupy the args slot.
