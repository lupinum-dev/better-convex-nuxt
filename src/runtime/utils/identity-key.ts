 * hash, role, or permission.
 *
 * Use this everywhere an identity-varying holder is keyed: SSR snapshots, client
 * auth, cache keys, payload keys, subscription keys, and identity generation.
 * There is deliberately exactly one implementation .
 *
 * @throws TypeError when a user is present but has no non-empty string `id`.
 *   A token without a resolved user id is not a settled identity and must keep
 *   auth-gated queries waiting; it must never produce `user:undefined`.
