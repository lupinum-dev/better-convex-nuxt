# Neutral consumer MCP package migration — 2026-07-22

## Outcome

The deployed neutral notes consumer now imports `createConvexMcpHandler` and `runMcpTool` from
`@better-convex/mcp`. Its direct official SDK registrations remain application-owned, but the fixture no
longer owns a bearer middleware, metadata handler, request-body reader, timeout loop, protocol handler,
or per-request SDK cleanup path.

The hard cut removed 199 lines from the former fixture MCP file and replaced them with 136 lines focused
on schemas, explicit tools/resources, safe text projection, and canonical Convex operations. There is no
legacy switch, generic dispatcher, duplicate parser, or token bridge.

## Gaps found and closed by the migration

The real consumer exposed four missing hosting obligations:

1. Loopback HTTP resources are required for anonymous local Convex development. Remote plaintext
   resources remain rejected.
2. A resource can declare baseline required scopes; the official verifier now returns the correct `403
insufficient_scope` challenge before protocol parsing.
3. The selected resource route is exact. Query-bearing, wrong-path, encoded, and browser-Origin requests
   fail empty and `no-store` before verification or application construction.
4. Every request-created official SDK handler is closed in `finally`.

No general transport configuration or second registry was added.

  focused package boundary passed

node scripts/check-package-exports.mjs --package mcp
  source and packed runtime/type graphs matched the reviewed official-SDK dependency

node scripts/check-candidate-apps.mjs --package mcp
  exact tarball installed in a clean Node 22 type/runtime consumer;
  installed bytes and two-value runtime export allowlist matched
```

The package still claims only experimental locked-RC behavior. Final specification and protected
artifact certification remain later gates.
