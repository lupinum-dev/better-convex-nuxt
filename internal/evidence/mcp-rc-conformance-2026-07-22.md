# MCP locked-RC conformance boundary — 2026-07-22

## Decision

The experimental MCP package targets the locked `2026-07-28` release candidate through the exact
official TypeScript SDK beta. It does not claim final-spec or stable-SDK compliance before July 28.

Conformance is intentionally split into two evidence layers:

1. `@modelcontextprotocol/conformance@0.1.16` remains the official-tool layer for the protocol
   revisions it actually advertises (`2025-06-18` and `2025-11-25`).
2. `runRcProtocolConformance` is a BCN black-box locked-RC layer driven by the exact official
   `@modelcontextprotocol/client@2.0.0-beta.5` client. It is not described as the official conformance
   suite.

The existing selected-scenario relay was not deleted because the official conformance package has not
yet published any `2026-07-28` server scenarios. Treating those scenarios as RC evidence would be a
false compliance claim. The final official suite remains a separate stabilization gate (`P9-004`).

## Exact dependency and publication checkpoint

Installed and lockfile-pinned on 2026-07-22:

```text
@modelcontextprotocol/client@2.0.0-beta.5
@modelcontextprotocol/server@2.0.0-beta.5
@modelcontextprotocol/core@2.0.0-beta.5
@modelcontextprotocol/conformance@0.1.16
@modelcontextprotocol/inspector@0.22.0
```

Primary sources checked:

- [MCP `2026-07-28` release-candidate announcement](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2026-07-28-release-candidate/)
- [official TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk)
- [official conformance suite](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/conformance)

The announcement says the RC was locked on May 21 and the final specification is scheduled for July 28. The SDK remains a prerelease and its repository still recommends v1 for production until the new
spec and stable v2 ship. Therefore this repository may build and certify an experimental package now,
but it may not promote the protocol or SDK contract as stable.

`pnpm exec conformance list --server` for `0.1.16` listed only `2025-06-18` and `2025-11-25` for every
scenario. It advertised no locked-RC scenario.

## Locked-RC invariants executed

The official v2 client is pinned to `2026-07-28` and must complete exactly two stateless requests:

- `server/discover`;
- `tools/list`.

The runner rejects any endpoint other than an exact `/mcp` URL and proves:

- no `initialize`, `notifications/initialized`, or `Mcp-Session-Id` exchange;
- exact `MCP-Protocol-Version`, `Mcp-Method`, and per-request client/version/capability metadata;
- complete result metadata with server name and version;
- an exact `tools`-only advertised capability surface;
- private, zero-TTL discovery and tool-list results;
- JSON Schema 2020-12 object-root tool inputs;
- fail-closed missing or mismatched `Mcp-Method`;
- fail-closed mismatched `Mcp-Name` for tool calls;
- method-not-found results for unadvertised prompts, resources, and Tasks;
- bearer absence from every inspected response.

Exact capability equality is the negative extension proof: Apps, Tasks, prompts, resources, roots,
sampling, and logging are not silently advertised by the base package consumer.

## Official-tool status

The current Inspector and official conformance versions previously passed the current-final
preflight against both topology candidates; see
`internal/evidence/mcp-official-tools-preflight-2026-07-22.md`. They do not certify the locked RC.

A full local OAuth run on 2026-07-22 reached the existing 56-test MCP gate, then Inspector `0.22.0`
failed to settle its legacy OAuth connection and timed out waiting for `Connected`. Its logs show the
v1 SDK transport and repeated authorization callbacks. This is recorded as an official-tool version
gap, not hidden as RC success and not worked around by weakening the stateless server contract. The
new RC runner itself executes before the legacy conformance relay once a bearer reaches the
conformance stage; exact deployed execution is owned by `P5-023`.

## Executed local proof

```text
pnpm exec vitest run --project=mcp test/mcp/mcp-runner-contracts.test.ts --reporter=dot
  1 file, 10 tests passed

pnpm exec eslint scripts/run-mcp-conformance.mjs test/mcp/mcp-runner-contracts.test.ts
pnpm exec oxfmt scripts/run-mcp-conformance.mjs test/mcp/mcp-runner-contracts.test.ts
git diff --check
```

The in-memory proof uses the official server handler rather than a BCN protocol double. `P5-023`
must execute the same RC runner against installed package bytes in the selected production Convex
runtime and retain the official legacy checks only for the versions they truthfully cover.
